            <h2>DUST II</h2>
            <p class="info">One of the most iconic maps in all of video-game history, Dust2 re-entered the Active Duty map pool in April of 2024 after two years of absence from pro play. Originally created in 2001, the map was the recipient of a Noclip documentary outlining how the classic map was created. 
            <br>
            It remains relevant to the game to this day, serving as the only available map in the initial version of the CS2 beta, allowing players to experience the graphical upgrades in comparison to the familiar CS:GO version.</p>

            <a href="mirage.html">Map Mirage</a>
            <h2>MIRAGE</h2>
            <p class="info">A map that hardly needs an introduction, Mirage is Counter-Strike's ageless staple. Originally a community map called de_cpl_strike, it was introduced to CS:GO officially in 2013 under its new name.
            <br>
            While the map is well known as an aimers map for online matchmaking, Mirage can have surprising tactical depth at the highest level, so remember to learn a few smokes before jumping into Premier to give your team the edge in your games.

            <h2>OVERPASS</h2>
            <p class="info"> Overpass is the largest map in CS2 by area, and that fact defines it in many ways. When it left the map pool, it was the most CT-sided map in the pool, with 55.4% of rounds going in favor of the defending side. Terrorists are forced to use utility to take space before reaching the sites, meaning executes can be difficult on Overpass’s bombsites while the CTs can quickly rotate between A and B.
            <br>
            In response, taking connector in the middle of the map is vital for the T side, allowing them to switch their bombsite target quickly and effectively, and allowing site executes to be faked.
